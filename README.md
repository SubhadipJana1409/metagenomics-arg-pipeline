# Metagenomic Profiling of Antibiotic Resistance Genes

This project explores antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in human gut microbiomes using publicly available shotgun metagenomic sequencing data. It applies tools like **Kraken2**, **Bracken**, and **DeepARG** for resistome and taxonomic profiling.

## üî¨ Pipeline Steps

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **01. Quality Control & Trimming** | Adapter removal and read trimming using `fastp` |
| **02. Taxonomic Profiling**        | Classification using `Kraken2` with visualizations |
| **03. ARG Annotation**             | Detection of resistance genes using `RGI` and CARD |
| **04. Visualization**              | Heatmaps, barplots, and pie charts in Python |

Each notebook is modular and reproducible.

---

## üìä Visual Outputs

- **Bar plots** showing ARG abundance per sample
- **Pie charts** for gene class distribution
- **Heatmaps** representing resistance gene frequency across samples

> All outputs are stored in `/results/figures/`

## üß™ Tools & Frameworks

- `Fastp` (QC)
- `Kraken2` (Taxonomy)
- `RGI` (Resistance annotation)
- `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib` (Plotting)
- `Biopython` (Sequence handling)
- `Python ‚â• 3.9`, `Conda` (Environment)
